He has been the roommate of fellow nerd Leonard Hofstader for several years when the series begins. Sheldon is the smartest person he knows and frequently reminds people of this. Even his friends have to hear why they are inferior to him. He is a creature of routine and becomes distressed when his comfortable world is upset. </p>

He has been roommates with Dr. Sheldon Cooper for several years when the series begins. Their living arrangement is dictated by a highly technical and intricate Roommate Agreement mostly written by Sheldon, which requires things such as Leonard washing his feet before getting in the shower and other extreme rules based on hygiene or not disrupting Sheldon's routine.</p>

		        <p class="text-center">Rajesh Ramayan "Raj" Koothrappali is a shy, nervous astrophysicist who works in the Physics Department at the California Institute of Technology. Raj's most defining characteristic is his inability to speak when he is around women, unless he is drunk, which only gives him a false sense of confidence. In order to communicate, he often whispers his thoughts to his best friend Howard Wolowitz, who says them out loud. Many people observe that Howard and Raj are like an old married couple.</p>

Howard fancies himself a ladies' man and hits on anything female including, frequently, Penny. He doesn't seem to understand that his aggressive advances come across as creepy and desperate. He uses groan-inducing pick-up lines, magic, and ventriloquism to try to get women, with predictably poor results.</p>

		        <p class="text-center">Penny is an aspiring actress who works as a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory and lives across the hall from Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper. Leonard immediately falls in love with his beautiful neighbor, but Sheldon sees her as a disruption to his routine and threat to his domestic tranquility (with key details codified in the Roommate Agreement).
		        Penny takes on a big sister or mother role for the rest of the group and eventually warms to Sheldon, taking care of him when he's sick, singing him the song his mom sang him, "Soft Kitty." </p>

						Penny introduces Bernadette to the perpetually-horny and on-the-prowl Howard Wolowitz and they somehow hit it off after discovering they both have overbearing mothers. (When Bernadette gets angry, she shouts and sounds just like Howard's gravelly-voiced off-screen mother.) Howard jokes that her parents' names are Adolf and Eva.</p>

		        <h3 class="text-center">Amy Farrah Fowler</h3>
		        <p class="text-center">Amy Farrah Fowler is a neurobiologist who meets Sheldon Cooper through online dating. She only signed up out of an agreement with her mother that she date once a year and Sheldon didn't sign up at all; Raj Koothrappali and Howard Wolowitz made a profile for him. Nevertheless, Amy likes Sheldon and Sheldon isn't bothered enough by her to get rid of her.
						They are similar in many ways, most notably their intellect and lack of social skills. Amy can be sanctimonious, rude and snobby. They vastly differ where it comes to sex drive: she has one, he does not. She is also not a fan of Star Wars, Star Trek or comic books.
						Much like Sheldon, she can often be condescending, including to Penny. Amy likes the idea of having a boyfriend and girlfriends, and soon gloms on to Penny as her "bestie."</p>

Stuart has a habit of asking out the women that one of the four main guys has already gone out with. He is particularly hung up on Penny.
						He is shy, insecure and has an encyclopedia knowledge of comic books. He hates confrontation.
						He occasionally hosts the actor Wil Wheaton, of "Star Trek: The Next Generation," and Sheldon Cooper's arch enemy, at the store.
						Background: He's a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design and a talented artist.
						He currently lives at his comic book store. His only neighbor is a stray cat that comes and goes that personally disappoints him when it doesn't show up.</p>
